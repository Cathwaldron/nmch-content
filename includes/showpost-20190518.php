<p class="openperfdesc">Alice Howe is a singer-songwriter from Boston, Massachusetts. Her pure, distilled sound reflects a musical sensibility rooted in &lsquo;60s folk and &lsquo;70s Southern California songwriters. Credit is due to Alice&lsquo;s parents for raising her on a steady diet of Taj Mahal, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Jackson Browne, and Joan Baez. As a performer, she is sure-footed and captivating, familiar to her audience from the very first song.</p>
