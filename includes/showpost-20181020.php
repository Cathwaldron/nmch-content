<p class="mainperfdesc">Founded as a trio in 1975, Mustard&rsquo;s Retreat&rsquo;s David Tamulevich, Michael Hough, and Libby Glover have  always sung the songs they enjoyed and cared about, regardless of the trends of the music industry and pop culture. They are committed to simply being themselves, not chasing fame or brass rings, while delighting in and connecting with their audiences as if they were family. The honesty of what they present onstage and the extensive body of outstanding original songs and recordings all contribute to a fiercely loyal audience that continues to grow. &ldquo;Music to cure what ails you&rdquo; was how one reviewer in the 1970s described them, and that is as true now as it was then. Join this wonderful night of music. </p>
