<h2>Save the Dates:</h2>

<dt><strong>April 15 - Cosy Sheridan</strong></dt>

<dd>Cosy Sheridan has been called one of the era’s finest and most thoughtful songwriters. Her numerous awards over the years and across the country have stemmed from the factthat she sees the joys and foibles of life in her own quirky way and then has the talent to put all that into finely crafted and oh-so-true songs.  Coupled with her bluesy guitar style, her upbeat and clever lyrics make for a thoroughly enjoyable evening. <br>

<dt><strong>May 20 - Kristen Ford</strong></dt>

<dd>An Indie rock rising star now living in Nashville but constantly touring (48 states and ten countries!), Kristen is a singer songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, trouble maker and bridger of the gap between worlds. As a queer bi-racial teen, she turned to music and made it her life’s work. Her five albums attest to the versatility of her music as she blends the styles of reggae, indie, folk and blues into a lively, unique all-body performance that even may include beatboxing. Ani DiFranco calls her “amazing” and the Worcester Telegram  says of her, “A little whimsical, clearly influenced by songwriting greats without losing her unique character, and offbeat enough to always have a bit of an edge.” <br>
