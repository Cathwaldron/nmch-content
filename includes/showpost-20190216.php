<p class="mainperfdesc">Tem Blessed was born in West Africa and came to New Bedford when he was just a few years old. Growing up in New England, it didnâ€™t take Tem long to fall in love with hip-hop. Before he even took the stage, the artist within him was already born. Tem started rhyming since the time he was a young boy. Seeing hip hop change and evolve throughout the years, Tem wanted to concentrate on making the world a better place. That led him to go green and lobby for a more sustainable world in addition to a better future for all of our children.</p>
