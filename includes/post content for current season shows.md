	<p>Grammy-nominated bluesman Guy Davis starts off our season with verve and vigor. Combining his acting genes inherited from his parents Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, his research into traditional blues, and his own creative and powerful songwriting, Guy delivers a memorable evening of music, guitar and stories. He is also a beloved teacher at SAMW  (Summer Acoustic Music Week)  organized by the folk radio station WUMB at 91.9 FM.  We are so glad to welcome Guy Davis back to the New Moon stage, and encourage you to reserve early to help us plan a wonderful start to the season. This show is truly a big deal!</p>

	<p>One of Canada’s best folksingers, Garnet Rogers treats us to his arresting baritone voice singing his own song stories and a few covers by friends within the international folk scene.  He and his late brother were considered one of the most influential acts in North American music until Stan’s tragic death in 1983. Because Garnet’s original songs are so literate, passionate and powerful, it is not surprising that he has used the downtime imposed by Covid to turn to creative writing. His books will be on sale at the show.</p>
