<p class="mainperfdesc">Blues musician and Grammy nominee Guy Davis is a songwriter, composer, actor, director, and writer. But most importantly, he is a bluesman. The blues permeates every corner of Davis' creativity. His music can be soulful, moaning out a people’s cry, or playful and bouncy as a hay-ride. He can tell you stories of his great-grandparents and his grandparents, they’re days as track linemen, and of their interactions with the infamous KKK. He can also tell you that as a child, raised by his well to do parents, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, that the only cotton he’s picked is his underwear up off the floor. Come hear the blues and more: “to me the blues is a broad title. I include some ragtime, I make a nod to New Orleans, and a nod to the fife and drum players. And I always include things that make you want to dance,” Davis explains. Join this wonderful night of music. </p>
